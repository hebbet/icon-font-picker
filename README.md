##font-awesome-picker

###What it should do

The package should allow access to a panel similar to [color-picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker), but with a searchable, visual list of the FontAwesome icon font.

When an icon is selected, the code for including the icon should be pasted into the editor, at the cursor's position.

Also, there should be some function or warning message about including font-awesome cdn or css in the project.
This is not decided on yet.
